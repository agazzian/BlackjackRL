# BlackjackRL


## Getting Started

QL_Agent is equipped with typical methods used in decaying epsilon-greey Q-learning.

Blackjack_Complete is a customizable blackjack environment for a learning agent to interact with


All Value Function Approximation (VFA) files are not complete

## Notes

VFA_TDv2 is meant to run on a CUDA-enabled GPU, although it is still somehow slower than training on the CPU
VFA_TDv2_CPU is the most updated version, it trains on CPU
VFA_TDv3 implements batch training on a CUDA-enabled GPU

VFA_TDv4 is an implementation of a custom-written sequential neural net. (VFA_Net.py)
* primary issue is that it converges to a constant function
