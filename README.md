## Getting Started

QL_Agent is equipped with typical methods used in decaying epsilon-greey Q-learning.

Blackjack_Complete is a customizable blackjack environment for a learning agent to interact with


All Value Function Approximation (VFA) files are not complete

## Notes

VFA_TDv2 uses the GPU to train; however, it is typically still slower than training on the CPU for some reason
VFA_TDv2_CPU is the most up-to-date file
VFA_TDv3 implements batch training, although it is still rather slow for large batches
